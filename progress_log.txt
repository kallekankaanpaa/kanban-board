I've been playing around with ways of making components and decided to use fxml
to define my UI. I've also created the basic card data class (it still lacks some features).

Card class has working implementations for:
    - Time tracking
    - Tags
    - Header
    - Description
    - Assignee

I've also added basic Tag, and Time classes which are used in cards.
I've created very lacking Attachment class as a placeholder for proper implementation

I've added basic tests for the time tracking and tag handling mehtods of Card

I haven't tracked the time I've been using too well but I would approximate that I've used
25-30 hours on this project so far. And I feel like I have figured out most of the basic stuff.

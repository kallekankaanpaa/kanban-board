I've been playing around with ways of making components and decided to use fxml
to define my UI. I've also created the basic card data class (it still lacks some features).

Card class has working implementations for:
    - Time tracking
    - Tags
    - Header
    - Description
    - Assignee

I've also added basic Tag, and Time classes which are used in cards.
I've created very lacking Attachment class as a placeholder for proper implementation

I've added basic tests for the time tracking and tag handling mehtods of Card

I haven't tracked the time I've been using too well but I would approximate that I've used
25-30 hours on this project so far. And I feel like I have figured out most of the basic stuff.

Last few week have been really busy with other school work so I've only managed to test out some functionalities and plann ahead.
That's why I haven't pushed any code to the repo.

I got basic board UI rendering working and created all necessary data classes for the program.
These data classes are still WIP and will change in future.

Got saving and loading of boards working

Next I'll concentrate on the dragging-and-dropping of cards and then I will make it possible to
add, remove, and modify cards and columns.

I'm a bit late of my schedule but I think I can finish the project on time.
